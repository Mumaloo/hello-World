# hello-World
For Learning and Practice:

I'm trying to learn to code so that I can better understand my husband.
Hopefully he will always be capable of working, but if not, I want to be prepared for anything.

I want to learn to code so I can be more self-sufficient. 
I'm currently learning Python, but have an interest in diving into HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
